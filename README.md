# Writing Neural Networks using NumPy 

I was excited to code neural networks from scratch so I started off coding the Linear network. I wrote multiple python files and included a README that tells you where to put your data, and where to download them from. I made it so that if you run "main.py" (optionally with arguments) everything just works.

Then I moved on to CNN where I lost all interest of making it work like it works in the Linear network. CNN only has a Notebook but you will still be able to learn how to do it if you read the notebook.
