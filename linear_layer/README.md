This is my implementation of a Linear Layer from scratch using NumPy. I have written a blog post about this, and I highly recommend you check it out at: https://learnwithuzal.wordpress.com/linear-layer-from-scratch/

### Dataset
To use this repository by yourself, you should download the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv and put the contents inside the data folder.
